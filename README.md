# products_app
A simple app using a .json file as 'database' for storing product data. Uses Ajax to store and display data.

See it live on [https://my-products-app.herokuapp.com](https://my-products-app.herokuapp.com).

Still in development; current issues
- Ajax not working on mobile and IE - only on Chrome
- The Edit link on data table not coded yet.
